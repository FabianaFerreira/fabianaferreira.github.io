## Hi you! ðŸ‘‹

Talking a little about me, I live in Rio de Janeiro, and I'm currently working at VTEX as a Software Engineer. I've graduated in Electronics and Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

I'm always looking for something new to learn, and I love to learn new languages; looking forward to reading books in Russian once I get enough knowledge to do so. Besides that, I love plants, and in my spare time, I crochet amigurumis.

These "blog" posts will be a part of a new personal initiative: keep in only one place things that I've learned daily. As time goes, I'll start documenting problems that I faced and how I solved them, notes that I take in my language courses, and, maybe, there will be a section only for my travel diaries, but I'm still thinking about it. 

> The main goal here is to make sure that I can keep the registration of things that I do want to save for later and to be able to search for them quickly, a capability that a notebook does not have.
