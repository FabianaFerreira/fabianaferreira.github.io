As a matter of information, [this page](https://www.chess.com/openings) from _chess.com_ has a lot of different opening and its defenses. 

## Queen's Gambit
Variation of `1.d4`. White strikes at Black's central pawn from the side.

```
1.d4 d5 2.c4
```

## King's Gambit
White sacrifices the f-pawn to knock out Black's central e5 pawn.
```
1.e4 e5 2.f4
```
> White would like to take over the center and regain the pawn on f4.

## Sicilian Defense
One of the major answers to `1.e4`. Black takes control of the d4 square with a pawn from the side.
```
1.e4 c5
```

## Reti
